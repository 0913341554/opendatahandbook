Digital technologies provide new ways to access and interact with data about civil and international conflict that is more comprehensive and immediate. Using said data so that it is both more digestible and interactive can encourage us to reflect in ways that otherwise wouldnâ€™t be possible. 

The [Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project](http://www.acleddata.com/data/) provides real time data about civil and international conflicts in Asia and Africa and publishes visualization and analysis. The data is aggregated from humanitarian agencies, research publications, the countries themselves, and local media.

Data Used: [Asia Data](http://www.acleddata.com/asia-data/), [Africa Data](http://www.acleddata.com/data/)
