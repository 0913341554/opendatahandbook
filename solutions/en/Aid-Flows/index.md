As a consequence of digital technologies, it is cheaper for citizens and donor countries to monitor receiving countries. Open data greatly reduces the cost of transparency and transferability of international aid data. While open data is hardly a panacea for international aidâ€™s negative effects, it does undoubtedly encourage a visibility to international aid that is unprecedented.

[Aid Flows](http://www.aidflows.org) is a portal that publishes all of the aid funds that it has donated over the past 10 years. All data is certified and published by the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation.
