Open data about the demographic and financial information of municipal, state, and federal level prisons can delineate a clearer picture of the prison industry and can help predict the impact of potential policy changes. 

Additionally, aggregating [data](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/) about incarceration on an international scale creates  comparisons that are increasingly important to an internationalized world in which countries looks to each other for successful policy models. 

The Prison Policy Initiative  published data on US state incarceration rates in comparison to countries of the world. Despite comparable crime levels to other industrialized countries, the United States incarcerates approximately five times as many people compared to the rest of the world.

Data Used: [Prison Census Data](http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/data/) [Global Incarceration Data](http://www.prisonstudies.org/research-publications?shs_term_node_tid_depth=27)
