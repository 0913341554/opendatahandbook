Luckily, property taxation data, a very crucial datapoint through which to view the impacts of gentrification, is often provided by municipal and state government taxation departments. Mapped property taxation data allows one to quantify a hard-to-conceptualize phenomenon through visualization. Open data sets on housing prices and property taxes overtime can give a comprehensive view of the where, what, and how of gentrification. 

Chris Whong, Akil Harris, and Ameen Soleman at the hackathon Code Across NYC used over 40,000 individual tax bills and connected this tax information to Map Pluto an open dataset of New York CItyâ€™s properties.  NYC Property Tax Explorer is an interactive map that allows one to zoom in and click on a particular property and view its corresponding tax information.

Data Used: [Map Pluto](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_pluto_mappluto.shtml#mappluto), [New York City Property Information](http://nycprop.nyc.gov/nycproperty/nynav/jsp/selectbbl.jsp)
