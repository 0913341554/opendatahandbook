The Urban Institute used an infographic for [federal](http://webapp.urban.org/reducing-federal-mass-incarceration/) and [state](http://webapp.urban.org/reducing-mass-incarceration/)prison levels that show forecasts of incarceration rates based on potential legislative changes to the lengths of prison sentences for different kinds of offenses. 

This use of open data to create a forecasting model allows one to see how legislative changes, if enacted, would impact the state of US incarceration.
