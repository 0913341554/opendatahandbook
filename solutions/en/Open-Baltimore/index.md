Luckily, property taxation data, a very crucial datapoint through which to view the impacts of gentrification, is often provided by municipal and state government taxation departments. Mapped property taxation data allows one to quantify a hard-to-conceptualize phenomenon through visualization. Open data sets on housing prices and property taxes overtime can give a comprehensive view of the where, what, and how of gentrification. 

The organization Open Baltimore uses data from the Maryland Department of Assessment and Taxation to filter through, visualize, and export data on city and state property taxes for all buildings in the city of Baltimore.
