title: Open movement
---

The open movement seeks to work towards solutions of many of the world's most pressing problems in a spirit of transparency, collaboration, re-use and free access. It encompasses {open data}, {open government}, {open development}, {open science} and much more. Participatory processes, sharing of knowledge and outputs and {open source} software are among its key tools. The specific definition of “open” as applied to data, knowledge and content, is set out by the {Open Definition}.
