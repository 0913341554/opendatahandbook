title: Linked data
---

A form of data representation where every {identifier} is an http://... {URI}, using standard lists (see {vocabulary}) of identifiers where possible, and where datasets include links to reference datasets of the same objects. A key aim is to make {data integration} automatic, even for large datasets. Linked data is usually represented using {RDF}. See also {five stars of open data}; {triple store}.
