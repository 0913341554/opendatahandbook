title: Five stars of open data
---

A rating system for open data proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide {Web}. To score the maximum five stars, data must (1) be available on the Web under an open {licence}, (2) be in the form of {structured data}, (3) be in a non-{proprietary} file format, (4) use {URIs} as its {identifiers} (see also {RDF}), (5) include links to other data sources (see {linked data}). To score 3 stars, it must satisfy all of (1)-(3), etc. The {Open Definition} requires data to score 3 stars in order to qualify as open, not requiring {RDF} or linking. This permits data of a wider variety of types and sources to be open, without the work of creating linking information.
