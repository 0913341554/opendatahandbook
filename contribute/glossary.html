<h2>The Open Data Handbook has a glossary page, for defining uncommon, or specialised terms.</h2>
<p>When using such terms you should:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check if they already exist in the glossary</li>
  <li>If they don’t exist, <a href="#adding">add them</a></li>
  <li><a href="#linking">Link to the terms</a> from your text</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll look at how to do steps 2 and 3 below.</p>

<h3 id="adding">Adding a term to the Glossary</h3>
<p>The glossary is maintained in a similar way to the Handbook menu, so if you’ve read the adding a page section, the process should be quite familiar.</p>
<p>To get started, navigate to the <code>handbook-glossary-en.yml</code> file on Github, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo }}/blob/gh-pages/_data/handbook-glossary-en.yml"><em>https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo }}/blob/gh-pages/_data/handbook-glossary-en.yml</em></a></p>

<p>Here you will see a list of terms, followed by <code>definition</code>, <code>see</code>, <code>link</code> or a combination thereof. Let’s have a quick look at what these keywords mean in this context.</p>

<h5>Term</h5>
<p>The word or phrase that you are defining. This must always be included.</p>

<h5>Definition</h5>
<p>The description of the word or phrase, which you wish to be displayed after the term. This should always be included, unless the definition is a duplicate of another in the glossary, in which case use <code>see</code>.</p>

<h5>See</h5>
<p>Adding a <code>see</code> value will include a link to another term in the glossary. This is useful if your term is defined elsewhere, in an acronym of the term for example. The value you define here must be the same as one of the <code>term</code> values in the document.</p>

<h5>Link</h5>
<p>The definitions in the glossary are only designed to accommodate a single paragraph of text. If you wish to provide a more detailed explanation, you should link to it elsewhere. A <code>link</code> value will generate a ‘<em>read more</em>’ link, which points to the URL you define here. A <code>link</code> value should therefore be a full URL, i.e <em>http://opendefinition.org/</em></p>

<p>OK, to start adding terms, first of all switch to the editable view on Github <code class="icon-pencil"><span>[pencil icon]</span></code>. Now find where in the list your term should go (it’s alphabetical) and create a new line.</p>

<p>In this example I want to add a definition for the term ‘<em>Open Definition</em>’, so I’m going to slot it in between ‘<em>Open Data</em>’ and ‘<em>Open Government Data</em>’</p>

<pre>
<code>    - term: "Open Data"
      definition: "Open data are able to be used for any purpose."
      link: “http://opendefinition.org"

    - term: "Open Government Data"</code>
</pre>

<p>Following the syntax of the document, I simply need to add my entry like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>    - term: "Open Data"
      definition: "Open data are able to be used for any purpose."
      link: “http://opendefinition.org"
    - term: "Open Definition"
      definition: "The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content."
    - term: "Open Government Data"</code>
</pre>

<p>At this stage you might be happy and ready to commit your changes. As mentioned above though, there are a couple of other options available here. Perhaps in the above example it might be good to reference ‘<em>Open Data</em>’, as the two are quite related. To do that just a line like so:</p>

<pre>
<code>    - term: "Open Definition"
      definition: "The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content."
      see: "Open Data"</code>
</pre>

<p>Better than that though, would probably be to link to the Open Definition itself, we can do that by adding a <code>link</code> value:</p>

<pre>
<code>    - term: "Open Definition"
      definition: "The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content."
      link: "http://opendefinition.org/od/"</code>
</pre>

<p>Now the outputted text on the site will read:</p>

<dl class="glossary">
  <dt>Open Definition</dt>
  <dd>The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content. <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/">Read more</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Perfect. You are ready to commit and make a pull request (see <a href="{{ "/contribute/adding/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Adding a Page</a>).</p>


<h3 id="linking">Linking to a Glossary term</h3>

<p>To reference a word or phrase in the glossary, you can link directly to that term on the page, you just need a little know-how.</p>

<p>The key piece of information you need to know is the ID of the term you are linking to. This will be the term as it appears in <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo }}/blob/gh-pages/_data/handbook-glossary-en.yml"><em>handbook-glossary-en.yml</em></a>, all in lower case, and any spaces replaced with hyphens (-).</p>

<p>For example, the ID for the term ‘<em>Open Definition</em>’ would be <code>open-definition</code>.</p>

<p>To look at what we do with this ID, let’s go through an example. Here is a little text, written in Markdown:</p>

<pre>
<code>The full Open Definition gives precise details as to what this means. To summarize the most important:

 * Availability and Access: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.
 * Reuse and Redistribution: the data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.
 * Universal Participation: everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute - there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.</code>
</pre>

<p>To link ‘<em>Open Definition</em>’ in the first line, to its entry in the glossary, we edit it like so:</p>

<pre>
<code>The full [Open Definition](/en/glossary/#open-definition) gives precise details as to what this means. To summarize the most important:</code>
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we have added a standard Markdown link to the Glossary page, with the address appended with a hash (#) then the aforementioned ID (open-definition).</p>
