title: Adding a term to the glossary
authors:

<p>Each glossary (meaning, each translated instance of the glossary), has three components:
<ul>
<li> A layout template for the glossary homepage: 'glossary.html'</li> 
<li> A layout template for the glossary in each language: 'glossary/{lang}/index.md'</li> 
<li> A directory of the glossary terms.. Each term in the directory is listed as the url slug (In English, all lower case letters, and hyphens instead of white spaces).</li>
</ul>
Currently, the English glossary has been updated and organized. Other languages please follow these [instructions]() 
To add a new term, all you need is to have a Github account. 

<h3>1: Create a folder for the term</h3>

<p>Log - in to Github and go to this link: <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_repo }}tree/gh-pages/glossary/en/terms" rel="external">here</a></p>

<p>You will see a the branch name (“gh-pages”) and a directory. The last symbol is a “+” to add a new file to the directory. Click on it.</>

<p>  Write the name of the term that you want to add in a new slug (In English, all lower case letters, and hyphens instead of white spaces) and add a “/” at the end of the terms name. This will create a new folder name. </p>

<h3>2: Create a file for your term</h3>

<p> Click on the “+” sign again. Now write in the path “index.md”. This will save the whole file as a markdown file.  </p>

<h3>3: Write the term definition </h3>
<p> In  the text editor below, add the front matter (Jekyll way to mark the page) - </p>
<pre>
---
section: terms
lang: en
title: // the term name //
---
</pre>

Write the term definition after the front matter as usual. 


<h3>4: Make a pull request</h3>

<p> Click on “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.” This will allow us to review your changes. <p/>

<p>Thank you! All done! If the handbook editors are happy with your term, it will be added to the glossary. </p>
