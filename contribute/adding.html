title: Adding a page

<h2>Most of what you need to know to add a new page is covered under ‘<a href="{{ "/contribute/editing/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Editing a page</a>’, so make sure you have first read through that section.</h2>

<p>Adding a page follows a similar process to editing. Instead of locating your page, your first step is to locate your new page’s parent directory.</p>

<h3>1: Create the page</h3>

<p>First locate the parent directory, or folder, in which your file will live. If you are adding a page to the English language Handbook, for example, you should be in the '<strong>en</strong>' directory, where you’ll see a list of all the Handbook pages.</p>

<p>Above the list of pages is a breadcrumb trail <code>{{ site.github_repo }} / guide / en /</code>, to the right of which is a plus symbol <code><strong>+</strong></code>. Click the plus symbol to create your new page.</p>

<h3>2: Name your file</h3>

<p>You should now have a new file editor page open. The first editable section you are presented with is the ‘<em>Name your file</em>’ field. As we touched upon when looking at <a href="{{ "/contribute/editing/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">editing files</a>, the file name corresponds to the URL of the page on the site. There are a few of rules to follow here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file name should reflect the title of the new page</li>
  <li>Must be unique</li>
  <li>Should be all lowercase</li>
  <li>Words should be separated by hyphens (-)</li>
  <li>File name should end with the extension '<em>.md</em>' (the .md extension indicates a markdown file)</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, if you were creating a page titled '<em>My Cool Page</em>', you would use a file name of:</p>

<pre>
<code>my-cool-page.md</code>
</pre>

<p>Assuming you are creating this in the '<em>en</em>' directory, this would result in a URL of <em>{{ site.url }}/en/my-cool-page</em></p>

<div class="note">
  <h6>Note</h6>
  <p>The actual words used in your file name are not crucial. It’s fine to use a more succinct version of your page title, for example.</p>
</div>

<h3>3: Formatting your content</h3>

<p>This step is the same as when editing a page. You need to start your file with the Front Matter, then add your content, formatting it using Markdown. Here is a template to get you started:</p>

<pre>
<code>---
title: My Cool Page
authors:
 - Fred Bloggs
---

##A large introductory paragraph.

Regular paragraphs, separated by empty lines.

###A heading

Another paragraph.

 * Maybe
 * a
 * list</code>
</pre>

<p>When you’re done, click ‘<em>Propose new file</em>’.</p>


<h3>4: Add page to menu</h3>

<p>Before you make your pull request, you need to add your new page to the site’s menu. On the pull request screen you’ll see a message telling you the name of the branch to which your new page was added. This will be something like <em><strong>patch-1</strong></em>, take note of this branch name.</p>

<p>Do not create a pull request, but navigate to https://github.com/<em><strong>yourusername</strong></em>/{{ site.github_repo }}/edit/<em><strong>branch</strong></em>/_data/handbook-contents-en.yml</p>

<div class="note">
  <h6>Note</h6>
  <p>‘<em><strong>branch</strong></em>’ represents the name you took note of previously, e.g. <em><strong>patch-1</strong></em>. If you are browsing to this manually, be sure to switch to this branch.</p>
</div>

<p>In this contents document, you’ll see a list of all the pages in the Handbook, accompanied by their respective file names, minus the extension (.md). It should look something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>- title: "Open Data Handbook"
  href: "introduction"
  lang: "en"
  subcategories:
    - subtitle: "Introduction"
      subhref: "introduction"
    - subtitle: "Why Open Data?"
      subhref: "why-open-data"
    - subtitle: "What is Open Data?"
      subhref: "what-is-open-data"</code>
</pre>

<p>The order in which the pages appear in this list, is the order they will appear in the website’s menu. So, if you think your new page should sit between ‘Why Open Data’ and ‘What is Open Data’, then you should edit the file like so:</p>

<pre>
<code>- title: "Open Data Handbook"
  href: "introduction"
  lang: "en"
  subcategories:
    - subtitle: "Introduction"
      subhref: "introduction"
    - subtitle: "Why Open Data?"
      subhref: "why-open-data"
    - subtitle: "My Cool Page"
      subhref: "my-cool-page"
    - subtitle: "What is Open Data?"
      subhref: "what-is-open-data"</code>
</pre>

<p>Pay attention to the indentations, it is important to keep the syntax and the formatting of this document consistent. When you are happy, go ahead and click ‘<em>Commit changes</em>’.</p>

<div class="note">
  <h6>Note</h6>
  <p>If your new content requires multiple pages, the above steps can be repeated in this branch.</p>
</div>

<h3>5: Make a pull request</h3>

<p>Once you have created your page(s) and updated the contents document, you're ready to make your pull request. Click the pull request icon to the right of the screen <code class="icon-git-pull-request"><span>[git pull-request icon]</span></code>, then click ‘<em>New pull request</em>’.</p>

<p>At the top of the resulting comparison screen, you’ll see a row of select boxes. You want to make sure these are configured like so:</p>

</article>
