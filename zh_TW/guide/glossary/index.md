Open Data 開放資料能夠應用在各類型的目的上，更詳細的資訊請參考[opendefinition.org](http://www.opendefinition.org/).

Machine-readable 所謂的機器可讀取的檔案格式意味著它們的數據能夠輕易的被電腦程式擷取。而PDF文件並不是機器可讀取的格式。電腦可以清楚的顯示PDF中的文字，但是在解讀文字以外的內容時，卻是非常的困難的。

Connectivity 網路連線環境指的是社群連接上網路的能力，尤其是有沒有辦法瀏覽網站。

BitTorrent BitTorrent 是一個目前政策決策者越來越熟習的系統，因為這個系統的使用與侵犯版權等相關問題常常被放在一起提到。BitTorrent 使用一種稱為 torrents 的檔案，然後在運作上可以將檔案散佈的資源分散平均分配到每個讀取該檔案的使用者身上。這樣一來，就算對資料檔案的要求提高，也可避免伺服器出現頻寬不足的狀況，因為越多人下載檔案，就表示越多人同時也在分享。

DAP

:   參閱 {term:Data Access Protocol}.

Data Access Protocol 一個提供認證機制，允許外部連線到資料庫並可避免系統產生超載的存取協定。

Attribution License

:   A license that requires that the original source of the licensed material is cited (attributed).

Data protection legislation

:   Data protection legislation is not about protecting the data, but about protecting the right of citizens to live without fear that information about their private lives might become public. The law protects privacy (such as information about a person's economic status, health and political position) and other rights such as the right to freedom of movement and assembly. For example, in Finland a travel card system was used to record all instances when the card was shown to the reader machine on different public transport lines. This raised a debate from the perspective of freedom of movement and the travel card data collection was abandoned based on the data protection legislation.

Information Asset Register

:   IARs are registers specifically set up to capture and organise meta-data about the vast quantities of information held by government departments and agencies. A comprehensive IAR includes databases, old sets of files, recent electronic files, collections of statistics, research and so forth.

    The {term:EU PSI Directive} recognises the importance of asset registers for prospective re-users of public information. It requires member states to provide lists, portals, or something similar. It states:

        Tools that help potential re-users to find documents available 
        for re-use and the conditions for re-use can facilitate 
        considerably the cross-border use of public sector documents. 
        Member States should therefore ensure that practical arrangements 
        are in place that help re-users in their search for documents 
        available for reuse. Assets lists, accessible preferably online, 
        of main documents (documents that are extensively re-used or 
        that have the potential to be extensively re-used), and portal 
        sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists are examples 
        of such practical arrangements.

    IARs can be developed in different ways. Government departments can develop their own IARs and these can be linked to national IARs. IARs can include information which is held by public bodies but which has not yet been – and maybe will not be – proactively published. Hence they allow members of the public to identify information which exists and which can be requested.

    For the public to make use of these IARs, it is important that any registers of information held should be as complete as possible in order to be able to have confidence that documents can be found. The incompleteness of some registers is a significant problem as it creates a degree of unreliability which may discourage some from using the registers to search for information.

    It is essential that the metadata in the IARs should be comprehensive so that search engines can function effectively. In the spirit of open government data, public bodies should make their IARs available to the general public as raw data under an open license so that civic hackers can make use of the data, for example by building search engines and user interfaces.

Open Government Data

:   {term:Open data} produced by the government. This is generally accepted to be data gathered during the course of business as usual activities which do not identify individuals or breach commercial sensitivity. Open government data is a subset of {term:Public Sector Information}, which is broader in scope. See <http://opengovernmentdata.org> for details.
