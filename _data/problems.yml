- problem: Gentrification
  p_overview: |
    Gentrification, or the rampant increase in property value of lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods, is widespread throughout the United States and the rest of the developing world. The increased valuation of property is not in itself what causes displacement, but rather  the drastic increase in property taxes that accompanies it.

    It is difficult to fully realize the systematic nature with which this displacement is occurring without a birdseye of the view of the phenomena. Gentrification is diffuse and on individual level basis hard to identify and thus difficult to create an awareness and advocacy campaigns.

    In short, every awareness and advocacy needs a medium and way to construct a message that is accessible and impactful to the non-expert concerned citizen before any substantive change can occur.

- problem: Incarceration Rates
  p_overview: |
    Incarceration in the United States is an 80 billion dollar a year business. It has some of the most lengthy sentences and highest per capita prisoner ratios in the world. America’s prison system is driven by profit and not by rehabilitation and public welfare.

    Those in prison are a voiceless population, whose inability to capture the public’s attention is reinforced by their low socio-economic and non-white status.
