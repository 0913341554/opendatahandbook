- problem: Gentrification
  p_overview: |
    Gentrification, or the rampant increase in property value of lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods, is widespread throughout the United States and the rest of the developing world. The increased valuation of property is not in itself what causes displacement, but rather  the drastic increase in property taxes that accompanies it.

    It is difficult to fully realize the systematic nature with which this displacement is occurring without a birdseye of the view of the phenomena. Gentrification is diffuse and on individual level basis hard to identify and thus difficult to create an awareness and advocacy campaigns.

    In short, every awareness and advocacy needs a medium and way to construct a message that is accessible and impactful to the non-expert concerned citizen before any substantive change can occur.

- problem: Incarceration Rates
  p_overview: |
    Incarceration in the United States is an 80 billion dollar a year business. It has some of the most lengthy sentences and highest per capita prisoner ratios in the world. America’s prison system is driven by profit and not by rehabilitation and public welfare.

    Those in prison are a voiceless population, whose inability to capture the public’s attention is reinforced by their low socio-economic and non-white status.

- problem: The Intersection of Ride-sharing and Public Transit
  p_overview: |
    Ride-sharing services, like Uber and Lyft are those services in which passengers ride in a private vehicle driven by the owner, for a fee or for free. The widespread adoption of ride-sharing services drastically changes how people get from place to place and as a result creates new policy challenges. Ride-sharing and transportation policy is made doubly difficult because private enterprises who own ride-sharing services inherently evade regulation.
  
    The extent to which ride-sharing enterprises are obligated to share their data for the scrutiny and well-being of the public sphere is doubtful. Additionally, there is increased need to provide environmentally friendly, and economically efficient transportation services on the part of governments, as they have historically regulated transportation for safety and environmental reasons. 
  
    As technologies evolve and redefine services that were once primarily within government purview there will need to be data that can triangulated in order to make sound policy decisions. Thus, there is greater necessity for governments and society at large to creatively use data to assess the impact of transportation services both old and new in ways impossible during the pre-digital and pre-mobile era.
