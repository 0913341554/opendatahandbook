- problem: Gentrification
  p_overview: |
    Gentrification, or the rampant increase in property value of lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods, is widespread throughout the United States and the rest of the developing world. The increased valuation of property is not in itself what causes displacement, but rather  the drastic increase in property taxes that accompanies it.

    It is difficult to fully realize the systematic nature with which this displacement is occurring without a birdseye of the view of the phenomena. Gentrification is diffuse and on individual level basis hard to identify and thus difficult to create an awareness and advocacy campaigns.

    In short, every awareness and advocacy needs a medium and way to construct a message that is accessible and impactful to the non-expert concerned citizen before any substantive change can occur.

- problem: Incarceration Rates
  p_overview: |
    Incarceration in the United States is an 80 billion dollar a year business. It has some of the most lengthy sentences and highest per capita prisoner ratios in the world. America’s prison system is driven by profit and not by rehabilitation and public welfare.

    Those in prison are a voiceless population, whose inability to capture the public’s attention is reinforced by their low socio-economic and non-white status.

- problem: Ride-sharing and Public Transit
  p_overview: |
   Ride-sharing services, like Uber and Lyft are those services in which passengers ride in a private vehicle driven by the owner, for a fee or for free. The widespread adoption of ride-sharing services drastically changes how people get from place to place and as a result creates new policy challenges. 

  Ride-sharing and transportation policy is made doubly difficult because private enterprises who own ride-sharing services inherently evade regulation.

  The extent to which ride-sharing enterprises are obligated to share their data for the scrutiny and well-being of the public sphere is doubtful. Additionally, there is increased need to provide environmentally friendly, and economically efficient transportation services on the part of governments, as they have historically regulated transportation for safety and environmental reasons. 

  As technologies evolve and redefine services that were once primarily within government purview there will need to be data that can triangulated in order to make sound policy decisions. Thus, there is greater necessity for governments and society at large to creatively use data to assess the impact of transportation services both old and new in ways impossible during the pre-digital and pre-mobile era. 

- problem: International Aid & Transparency
  p_overview: |
    Throughout the late twentieth and early twenty first century the lack of transparency surrounding international aid has created three primary issues. 

    1. International aid, while a catalyst for economic development and a necessity in times of crisis is, due to its opaqueness, often a source of corruption on the side of receiving governments, donor countries, intergovernmental, and non-governmental organizations. 

    2. International aid has been the conduit through which donor countries try to impose undue foreign policy influence. Funds that are intended for the overall benefit of receiving countries can come with tacit stipulations. While external influence is inevitable in any kind of international aid, a more informed citizenry and international community can help to clarify what aid is political in nature and thus help to prevent nefarious manifestations of such influence. 

    3. It is unequivocal that some kinds of international aid have positive impacts for donor countries and other kinds can worsen existing circumstances. Without verifiable and comprehensive data, policy and academic research is greatly limited in its ability to assess the impact of past international aid campaigns and effectively plan for future campaigns. 

    The status quo of international aid data has, for a variety of reasons, been that of intransparency. Recipient countries haven’t had the infrastructure and or strong enough democratic institutions to disclose the where, when and how aid money was being spent. The International Aid Transparency Initiative provides a technical publishing framework for international aid data.
    
- problem: Tracking Modern Warfare
  p_overview: |
  
  Sustained civil and international conflict is complex, difficult to measure, and often highly politicized. Knowledge about violence in conflict is often piecemeal and error ridden. 
It is not easy for an individual to learn about country’s contemporary and past history of conflict.   

  This problem is made twofold by modern day warfare which relies on technologies that do not need military personnel to endanger themselves. Despite being hailed as a more deliberate, controllable, and therefore ‘humane’ way of waging conflict, the aggregate effect of this new warfare is just as destructive and devastating as traditional warfare, but due to its non-civilian and dispersed nature it is easier to hide and less demanding of attention. Ultimately for those types of violence whose manifestations are less visible there needs to be a pronounced effort to educate and inform the public.
