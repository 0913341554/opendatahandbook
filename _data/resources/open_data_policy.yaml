  Description: This paper attempts to present the underlined ideology of the Open
    Government Data and Right To Information movements, which have fashioned the access
    to government information and to substantiate that the way to the future is a
    one-way street towards the greatest possible dissemination of government information
    as this can be established by the synergy of RTI and OGD in order to preserve
    and promote the primary human and political right to receive information so as
    to be informed and able to freely express opinions, ideas and thoughts.
