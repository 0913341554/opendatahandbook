title:  "6 million pounds in 15 Minutes - how the UK Government saved money with open data"

This article reports how a senior UK government official use open data about government spending to save Â£6 million pounds in fifteen minutes.

It shows that one of the biggest beneficiaries of government open data programs can be **government itself**. This may seem surprising as government already has access to its own data. However, in reality,  there are many obstacles to effective information sharing within government - so that even if data exists, friction may prevent it "flowing" to where it is most needed and most valuable.

We emphasize this point that a significant value of open data may lie in improved and more efficient government decision-making because it is distinct from - and complements - the more frequently cited benefits around innovation and transparency driven by third-party use in businesses and civil-society.[^fn]

[^fn]: Obviously the open data approach is only suitable for non-personal data. Much government data is personal in nature, for example, tax records or social security records, and would never be shared as open data.
### The story

In 2010, the UK began publishing government spending data as open data, first in the form of the central government budgetary database (COINS) and then with an announcement to publish individual transactions at Open Government Data Camp in November 2010.

The commitment to publish departmental spending at the transactional level - that is individual purchases from suppliers - on a monthly basis was a major step beyond what any other government had done before and positioned the UK as a global leader in fiscal transparency. At the same time, when the decision was made the government frankly accepted that they did not know the exact benefits that would arise.

Fast forward three and a half years. Liam Maxwell, the UK Government CTO is talking with a CIO-level colleague from another government department. In conversation they mention that they have recently purchased an expensive market research report for senior IT decision makers. These reports, whilst valuable, are extremely expensive. Liam is a man intent on getting maximum value for money in government IT - especially in a post Great Recession world. These market reports are expensive, are other government departments buying these reports he wonders? Perhaps it is even possible that different departments are even buying the the same report?

It is worth taking a moment here to reflect on what would have happened in the "old", pre open spending data days. Liam would have had a simple choice. On the one hand, he could simply have dismissed this question from his mind and moved on to the many other things he had to do. End of story. On the other hand, he could have decided to pursue it. Whilst there is a central budgeting and reporting system in the UK government for many years living in the Treasury, this system, like most government financial management platforms, does not track information at a transactional level. Instead, departments will report spending against particular finance codes and projects. At best, Liam would be able to look something like total spending on marketing if there was a specific code for that. So that would be a dead end - even if he could access the system (which are generally notoriously complicated requiring dedicated staff to manage and enter information).

His next, and only remaining, option would be to write to CIOs or other relevant officials across government and ask them to tell him what market research reports they purchased and at what cost. How would this go? Liam would need to write the request - or task a staff member to do so. This would then get sent out. Likely weeks or months would go by as this request worked its way to the top of the pile in other departments. Some departments might lose the request or never get round to responding - some might not even want to respond. Ultimately, weeks or months later Liam would be lucky to have a partial picture of how things stood.

Reflecting on this option, its likely that Liam would quickly decide to save himself the time and energy and go with the first option: forget it and move on - perhaps filing it mentally in the drawer of "things to look at again later when I am less busy".

So what happened differently?

Because the government published its transactional data openly it was already all online and, of course, it included spending on expensive market research reports. There was the problem that each government department publishes their data in separate monthly CSV files which means you would have to search across hundreds of different spreadsheets to find the data. However, because the data was open, another organization outside of government had taken the role of "infomediary" and had aggregated all those files into one conveniently searchable whole.

It was therefore a matter of minutes - just under fifteen to be precise - for Liam to do a quick search across all government spending and find out which departments were buying which reports and to see what duplication there was. Total estiamted savings from eliminating that duplication and buying one copy for everyone: **just under six million pounds.**


### Conclusion

This story is not just powerful in itself, it also illustrates several key points about the potential and use of open data:

1. **Data must be connected to a concrete problem or opportunity to generate value**. This is obvious, but it is worth reiterating and this story provides a concrete example of how this happens.
2. **Uses are unexpected**: what open data can be used for and where it will generate value is often difficult to foresee. When the UK government committed in 2010 to release detailed transactional spending information it almost certainly did not anticipate the use reported here.
3. **The use was *inside* government**: that is, it was a government official who used the data and took action. This illustrates a key point that one of the biggest potential beneficiaries of government open data is government itself (this may seem paradoxical since government already has the data - more on this below).
4. **Infomediaries matter**: the raw open data released by government would not have been useful since each department published data in dozens of different files. Thanks to a third-party platform - OpenSpending - this data had been aggregated and made easily searchable.
5. **The "many minds principle" for government**: the best thing to do with your data will be thought of by another department (or civil servant). By opening up data we can reduce friction in data sharing, accelerating "time to insight" and "time to action"** - a  question can  turn into an answer in just fifteen minutes generating a basis for actionable, concrete change that saved government money.


### Other Evidence 

> When I am having a meeting with my team, especially around expenses the first thing I do is pull the spend data from data.gov.uk. I use that information on a regular basis and often use that rather than data I can pull from an internal system because it is quicker and easier. I would also add, and I emphasize this is anecdotal, that we have seen a reduction in expenses claim and an easier time of processing expenses since we start publishing in this way.
